## InetAddress tester
Small class (and jar) to quickly check the elapsed time spent from the Java layer to access the localhost domain name.

I had few issues after upgrading from MacOS X El Capitan to MacOS Sierra and now the elapsed time passed from ~5ms-30ms to ~5000ms

###Usage:
`java -jar bin/inetTester.jar`
